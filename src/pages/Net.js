          The act of getting your haircut is a very intimate “thing”. It is a culture that fosters a community where Barbers don’t just cut hair. Their clients see them as confidants – therapists almost – whom they are able to share the most intimate details of their lives with. Marvin Church, who holds numerous titles as barber, educator, and influencer, describes barbershops as “safe havens” where your barber is someone you can confidently share with (Moratto, 2021).
          <br></br><br></br>
The environment of barbershops stays the same as multiple generations go to the same barber Tapered Throne by Brandon Tauszik is a set of black and white GIF images that gives viewers an intimate look into the lives of African American barbers. 
<br></br><br></br>
The “portrait of oakland’s black barbers“ highlights the numerous roles played by these barbers in the development and sustenance of the black community outside of making a living. They are a hub of storytelling, comradery, and authentic expression. The accompanying essay “Tapered Throne Introduction” by Quincy T. Mills, Ph.D provides an insightful and informative analysis of Tauszik’s project by further elaborating on the value of barbers in the black community. I believe Tapered Throne functions well as net/web art as it brings a deeper dimension to the traditional black and white photograph. The project is about black barbers and the kinds of relationships they foster with their clients and other black people in the community. For them, being a barber is not just about cutting hair but providing a space where people can come and express themselves freely and revel in their ‘blackness’. The author of the book “You Next”, Antonio Johnson notes that “these were more than just places to get a trim”. The setting is in Oakland, California; a place that residents have described as taken over by crime and poverty.
<br></br><br></br>
The GIFs, that depict barbers from different barber shops around Oakland, are accompanied by a caption by the featured barber and a profile that lists their name, shop, the year the portrait was captured and the number of frames that make up the gif. Some of the themes that appear throughout the portraits include the passion and skill that comes with cutting black hair. It is not seen as just skilled labour but an art.
<br></br>
I believe the seamless loop of the gifs mimics the up and down rhythmic strokes of the hair clippers. 
<br></br><br></br>
All the GIFs are captured in black and white which helps to bring attention to the subjects of the image without the distraction of colour (Rehman, 2021). It encourages the viewer to pause and look at the composition and feel the emotions captured in the frame.
<br></br><br></br>
“Barbers tend to look like the boys they serve…” - Alvin Irby.
<br></br>
The building of a community where generations of clients get their hair cut at one shop is not
uncommon. Sometimes the clients go on to become the barbers themselves which results in a holistic experience of knowing what it is like to be in the chair and to hold the clippers.
